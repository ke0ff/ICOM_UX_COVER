# ICOM_UX_COVER
Replacement cover for the front of the ICOM IC-900 UX Transceiver modules

"uxcover.stl" is a "standard" replacement cover which attempts to reproduce the original ICOM UX cover.

"uxcover_tall.stl" is 6mm deeper than the original cover and supports the UXFFront Unit modification.
    It provides more space for the DB-9 connector used by the mod.
    
There are now several user definable parameters in the "uxcover.scad" source to allow for easy
    customization of the cover (see www.openscad.org to download OpenSCAD for your platform).
    Primarilly, up to 10mm of additional can be added.  The dimensions have been updated and
    the resulting fit is very good.
