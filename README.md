# ICOM_UX_COVER
Replacement cover for the front of the ICOM IC-900 UX Transceiver modules

"uxcover.stl" is a "standard" replacement cover which attempts to reproduce the original ICOM UX cover.

"uxcover_tall" supports the UXFF Front Unit modification.  It provides more space for the DB-9
    connector.
    
There are now several user definable parameters in the "uxcover.scad" source to allow for easy
    customization of the cover (see www.openscad.org to download OpenSCAD for your platform).
